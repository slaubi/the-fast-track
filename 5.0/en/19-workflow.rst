Making Decisions with a Workflow
================================

Having a state for a model is quite common. The comment state is only determined by the spam checker. What if we add more decision factors?

We might want to let the website admin moderate all comments after the spam checker. The process would be something along the lines of:

* Start with a ``submitted`` state when a comment is submitted by a user;

* Let the spam checker analyze the comment and switch the state to either ``potential_spam``, ``ham``, or ``rejected``;

* If not rejected, wait for the website admin to decide if the comment is good enough by switching the state to ``published`` or ``rejected``.

Implementing this logic is not too complex, but you can imagine that adding more rules would greatly increase the complexity. Instead of coding the logic ourselves, we can use the Symfony Workflow Component:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ symfony composer req workflow

Describing Workflows
--------------------

The comment workflow can be described in the ``config/packages/workflow.yaml`` file:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: config/packages/workflow.yaml
    :emphasize-lines: 3,4,9,11

                        from: potential_spam
                        to:   rejected
                    publish_ham:
                        from: ham
                        to:   published
                    reject_ham:
                        from: ham
                        to:   rejected

    single: Command;workflow:dump

To validate the workflow, generate a visual representation:

.. code-block:: bash
    :class: ignore

    $ symfony console workflow:dump comment | dot -Tpng -o workflow.png

.. image:: images/workflow.png
    :align: center

.. note::

    The ``dot`` command is a part of the `Graphviz`_ utility.

Using a Workflow
----------------

Replace the current logic in the message handler with the workflow:

         }
     }

The new logic reads as follows:

* If the ``accept`` transition is available for the comment in the message, check for spam;

* Depending on the outcome, choose the right transition to apply;

* Call ``apply()`` to update the Comment via a call to the ``setState()`` method;

* Call ``flush()`` to commit the changes to the database;

* Re-dispatch the message to allow the workflow to transition again.

As we haven't implemented the admin validation, the next time the message is consumed, the "Dropping comment message" will be logged.

Let's implement an auto-validation until the next chapter:

             }

Run ``symfony server:log`` and add a comment in the frontend to see all transitions happening one after the other.
